### Description

What's Metro shaped and has an ESP32-S2 WiFi module? What has a STEMMA QT connector for I2C devices, and a Lipoly charger circuit? What's finishing up testing and nearly ready for fabrication? That's right - its the new Adafruit Metro ESP32-S2! With native USB and a load of PSRAM this board is perfect for use with CircuitPython or Arduino, to add low-cost WiFi while keeping shield-compatibility

Features:

* ESP32-S2 240MHz Tensilica processor - the next generation of ESP32, now with native USB so it can act like a keyboard/mouse, MIDI device, disk drive, etc!
* WROVER module has FCC/CE certification and comes with 4 MByte of Flash and 8 MByte of PSRAM - you can have huge data buffers
* Lotsa power options - 6-12VDC barrel jack or USB type C or Lipoly battery
* Built-in battery charging when powered over DC or USB
* UNO-shape so shields can plug in
* Reset and DFU (BOOT0) buttons to get into the ROM bootloader (which is a USB serial port so you don't need a separate cable!)
* Serial debug pins (optional, for checking the hardware serial debug console)
* JTAG pads for advanced debugging access.
* On/Off switch
* STEMMA QT connector for I2C devices
* On/Charge/User LEDs + status NeoPixel
* Works with Arduino or CircuitPython
* 53.2mm x 72mm / 2" x 2.8"
* Height (w/ barrel jack): 14.8mm / 0.6"
* Weight: 22.5g
